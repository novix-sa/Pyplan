# UI Designer
Pyplan has a specific layer for **app deployment** .

This layer can be accessed by clicking on the icon `Interfaces` located on the left side of the screen.

## Layout
Interfaces manager shows those I/O Interfaces created by the user and those that were  shared by someone else. 

Shared interfaces can only be browsed unless they are copied to user own space.

For doing this **Right click** on the interface and select the option **Copy to My Interfaces**.

Once it has been copied user has total control over that interface.

**Favs app** for quick access can also be set once the user owns the interface.

## Creating an Interface
If you want to create and interface from scratch click on `New` and select `interface`. 

Define a name for it and double click on your new interface.

White interface will open with one single widget.

New widgets can be added by pressing `+` and each of  them has the following characteristics.
![enter image description here](http://img.pyplan.org/Ui_blanck_interface.png)

Each widget can be used for presenting information from the influence diagram choosing among the different layouts explained on section  `Node Visualization`. 

There are **two ways of selecting objects from diagram to represent them in an interface**.

1- Selecting type of data from the wizards menu and searching object by title or id on the window that pops up:

2- Use one widget to expose influence diagram and ,pressing <kbd>click+Shift</kbd>, drag and drop the object you want to be represented from the diagram into a new widget:

*Hint: If you were the one that created the model this second option will appear useful for you.*
## I/O Interfaces
Interfaces can have inputs as well as outputs widgets.

If you need to create an **input widget you should choose a pivot grid.**

For instance, in this example `market growth` information can be modified to simulate different scenarios, you may want to do this on your interface that is why it is presented as a pivot grid:
![enter image description here](http://img.pyplan.org/UI_pivot_input.png)

By dragging dimension in the correct order and pressing <kbd>ok</kbd> you build your input interface.

### Other input objects
There are other interesting input objects:`indexes` (dimensions) and `selector`.

Indexes can be explicitly exposed on interfaces so that filtering  along dimensions is easier.

If you need to set an **index widget** just drag it from de diagram or search for it using wizard object.
**Indexes widget has their specific options menu.**

**Selector object** can also being dragged and dropped from diagram to create an input widget.

## Synchronization
Once an interface has been created dimensions shared by objects in that interface are automatically synchronized.

That means that **every selection in any part of the interface will apply to every presented object** unless explicitly defined the opposite.

Letâ€™s suppose you have created an interface like the following where `region`, `item type` and `time`are explicitly exposed.
 
*Hint: check how text widget and background colours can help interfaces be more self explaining*.

If you select a **single region, a couple of items and a range of time** these selections will apply to all interface.

**Remember you can always choose to des-synchronized indexes as explained in `Node visualization` section.

## Deploying an App and Sharing
Once you have created various interfaces you may need to generate an application for sharing it with other users or even publicly.

**Creating an application**

Creating an application is as simple as selecting `Application` from menu and defining a name for it.

![enter image description here](http://img.pyplan.org/UI_create_app.png)

By **dragging and dropping** previously created interfaces in the application deployment is done.

**Sharing an application**

Select the application and press right bottom to access the following menu:
![enter image description here](http://img.pyplan.org/UI_share_app.png)

**Share the application externally and make it accessible for every person with the link.**

Congratulations your [python](https://www.python.org/) coded application has been deployed.
