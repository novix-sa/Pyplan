Pyplan has a specific layer for **App deployment** once calculation on influence diagram layer has been concluded.
This layer can be accessed by clicking on the following icon and final user is able to generate Apps and Interfaces that can be easily shared.

## Layout
Interfaces manager shows those IO Interfaces created by user and those that were  shared by some other user. In this case user can only browse interfaces unless he copied them to his own space.
Once it has been copied user has total control over that interface.
Favs App can also be set.

White Interface will open with one single widget.

New widgets can be added by pressing `+` and each of  them has the following characteristics.

Each widget can be used for presenting information from the diagram choosing among the different layouts explained on section  `Visualization` 

There are **two ways of selecting objects from diagram to represent them on an interface**.

1- Selecting type of data and searching object title or id:

2- Use one widget to expose diagram and using <kbd>click+Shift</kbd> drag and drop the objet into a new widget:

If you were the one that created the model this second option will appear useful for you
## I/O 
Interfaces can have inputs as well as outputs widgets.

If you need to create an **inputs widget you should choose a pivot grid.**

For instance, in this example `market growth` information can be modified to simulate different scenarios, you may want to do this on your interface.

By dragging dimension in the correct order and pressing ok you build you input interface.
